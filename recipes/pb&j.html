    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>The Peanut butter & Jelly sandwich is a staple. Whether it is a busy morning brekfast, an evening snack, or a midday craving, a pb&j will not only satisfy your stomach but your taste buds too.</p>
    <p>this one is a pretty simple and straight forward recipe, so I hope you enjoy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread of your choice</li>
        <li>Helly of your choice (grape jelly is what we have opted to use)</li>
        <li>peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First take your 2 slices of bread and either toast them in a toaster or toast them on a medium to high heat pan until the bread has some gloden brown color to it.</li>
        <li>Spread a thick layer of peanut butter on one slice of the bread (a butter knife will probably make this an easier task.)</li>
        <li>Spread the jelly on the other slice of toast and also make sure there is a thick layer of it (a spoon is probably the best way to do this.)</li>
        <li>Finally, put your 2 slice of toast together and voila, you have yourself the perfect crunchy and tasty peanut butter & jelly sandwich.</li>
    </ol>
