    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Bread omlette is a fantastic, but quick and easy dish you can make that will excite both kids and adults alike. This is a flavorful and aromatic dish that you could out your own spin on once you get the hang of it.</p>
    <p>Some of the ingredients I will be using are not 100% necessary, and I will mention which ingredients those are, so keep an eye out for that. With that said, enjoy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread of your choice</li>
        <li>1 or 2 eggs</li>
        <li>A quarter of a finely chopped red or white onion</li>
        <li>One green chili roughly chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 or 2 finely chopped mushrooms (optional)</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</salt>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl mix the eggs, onion, chili, and mushroom</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to your liking</li>
        <li>Mix until all the ingredients are incorporated well</li>
        <li>Add this mixture to a pan on high heat, try to make the mixture form a rectangular shape to fit the bread, but no problem if it doesn't</li>
        <li>Quickly place both slices of bread, so the side facing down gets coated and quickly flip both slices before they stick to the egg so as to have the flavor on both sides of the bread</li>
        <li>Turn your sandwich to toast the other side once the egg has cooked</li>
        <li>Take it off the pan, fold, and voila, you have your bread omlette. Serve it with ketchup, hot sauce whatever you like, it's sure to be a hit.</li>
    </ol>
